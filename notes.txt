TODOS

    add server config
        ip, port, and domain of server
        dmx on/off and universe and device
        midi on/off
        osc on/off, domain, port
        maybe even colors and pictures?


    error pattern could be made different
        look at node.js error pattern in callback style
        first argument is error, then stuff


    check which functions can be made static
        some functions just do not change or anything
        and can be used like in the prototype object
        if they do not need access to the private members
        or if those members can be passed
        or just use bind


    find a nice way to make the io instance available to all modules
        but global would be uncool
        at the moment it is passed to object by reference in the config object
        UPDATE: I guess that is the best way to do this?


    overwork the way of logging
        add some ids and more useful information
        and some colors...


    call super functions nicer somehow
        at the moment we even have to check if there is this function in the shared object
        UPDATE: do we even have to call superfuncs or is it cool that way?
