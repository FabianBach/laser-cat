TODOS

    error pattern could be made different
        look at node.js error pattern in callback style
        first argument is error, then stuff


    check which functions can be made static
        some functions just do not change or anything
        and can be used like in the prototype object
        if they do not need access to the private members


    find a nice way to make the io instance available to all modules
        but global would be uncool
        at the moment it is passed to object by reference in the config object


    overwork the way of logging
        add some ids and more useful information
        and some colors...


    call super functions nicer somehow
        at the moment we even have to check if there is this function in the shared object


BUGS

    no bugs yet... phew
